**Introductions**

The objective of this project is to develop a deep time series learning system to predict Covid-19 infection rate over time based on the data from the past 30 days.

**Instructions**

The main file is `Covid 19 Cases PredictionAssignment.ipynb`, where running all the cells will perform its deep learning operation after downloading the dataset. There is no separate class .py file as it is already integrated within the main file.

The dataset is also not included in this repository as it will be automatically downloaded when the python file.
